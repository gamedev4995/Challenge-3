## Probuilder
For this proyect we used Probuilder to allow us easy access alteration for our shapes. To see our Probuilder tools, at the menu at the top go to Tools > Probuilder > Probuilder window. This will make our variety of tools visible.

For our Proyect we will be using this tiny window on our scene. The 1st square is Object Selection, the standard Unity settings.  The 2nd is Vertex selection, for editing vertices for detailed editing and functions like vertex splitting and connecting. The 3rd is Edge Selection, to edit edges for semi-complex geometry editing. The last and 4th is Face Selection to select and edit faces on an object, for basic tasks like extruding.

## Materials

We also created our own materials and textures to give our pyramid and landscape a more realistic look to it.

## Short Story
- In Echoes Beneath, you play as Tlalli, a young warrior in the Aztec Empire. The game begins with a tourist guide sharing the legend of Tlalli to a group of tourists visiting the Main Temple. The legend states that after a mysterious earthquake hits Tenochtitlan, the high priests ask Tlalli to investigate Huēyi Teōcalli, the Main Temple. They fear the earthquake is tied to an old prophecy that warns of a disaster if the balance between the gods and the world is disturbed. Tlalli’s mission was to explore the temple and find out what’s causing the disturbance before it’s too late.
- As Tlalli journeys through the temple, the player would face puzzles, traps, and fierce creatures from Aztec mythology. The deeper the player goes, more secrets about the prophecy get revealed. Here the player could encounter bosses, weapons, and ancient relics that could provide status enhancements or new abilities.
- In the end, Tlalli makes a difficult decision that could change the fate of the city. How the story unfolds depends on the choices they make, leaving players to decide how the prophecy will play out. Ultimately, the game would explore themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the weight of one's choices in the face of divine power.
