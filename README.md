# Challenge 3

Celebrating Mexico’s Independence day that was September 15th, for this challenge we built an ancient Pyramid and it’s landscape in honor of the many rich cultures that represent Mexico!

## ProBuilder
For this proyect we used Probuilder to allow us easy access alteration for our shapes. To see our ProBuilder tools, at the menu at the top go to Tools > ProBuilder > ProBuilder window. This will make our variety of tools visible.

For our Proyect we will be using this tiny window on our scene. The 1st square is Object Selection, the standard Unity settings.  The 2nd is Vertex selection, for editing vertices for detailed editing and functions like vertex splitting and connecting. The 3rd is Edge Selection, to edit edges for semi-complex geometry editing. The last and 4th is Face Selection to select and edit faces on an object, for basic tasks like extruding.

## Materials

We also created our own materials and textures to give our pyramid and landscape a more realistic look to it. To create a new material, we simply right clicked inside our Materials folder to get a dropdown, clicked Create > Material. For each basic color, we went to the menu on the right and selected our preferred colors from base map. Meanwhile for our textures, we clicked the dot beside base map which opens up a small window to search for our textures and select from there.

## Assets

In Unity's Assets Store, we installed and imported the following FREE assets to decorate the landscape a bit and bring more life into the scene:

1. 2022 PBR XfrogPlants Sampler - Tree & plant models

## Short Story
- In _Echoes Beneath_, you play as Tlalli, a young warrior in the Aztec Empire. The game begins with a tourist guide sharing the legend of Tlalli to a group of tourists visiting the Main Temple. The legend states that after a mysterious earthquake hits Tenochtitlan, the high priests ask Tlalli to investigate Huēyi Teōcalli, the Main Temple. They fear the earthquake is tied to an old prophecy that warns of a disaster if the balance between the gods and the world is disturbed. Tlalli’s mission was to explore the temple and find out what’s causing the disturbance before it’s too late.
- As Tlalli journeys through the temple, the player would face puzzles, traps, and fierce creatures from Aztec mythology. The deeper Tlalli goes, more secrets about the prophecy get revealed. Here the player could encounter bosses, weapons, and ancient relics that could provide status enhancements or new abilities.
- In the end, Tlalli makes a difficult decision that could change the fate of the city. How the story unfolds depends on the choices they make, leaving players to decide how the prophecy will play out. Ultimately, the game would explore themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the weight of one's choices in the face of divine power.

## Experience Gained

I really enjoyed getting to see the scene come together and seeing the creativity from my teammates. This project made us struggle a lot with the assets in particular, but we were able to manage it well enough in the end. Working on this brought back some good memories from my life. One of them was when I had to make a hand-crafted model of Tenochtitlan in my history class in 8th grade. The other was when I had visited the Tulum Mayan ruins in Mexico from a cruise across Central America. So, overall, I felt a lot of joy working on this challenge and having to apply everything we have learned so far in the class.

This project really helped me think outside the box, considering how almost the entirety of the pyramid is made simply of cubes. At first, it was challenging to think about how to incorporate each element we wanted to create and bring to life, but as I kept playing around with the cubes and shapes, the easier it got to imagine all the things I could do. Using ProBuilder really enhanced my abilities as well, due to how useful the tool is. It was easy to work with and manipulate shapes into what we wanted them to be. I feel like this project really helped me widen my perspective on how to approach and implement new things that I know will be incredibly helpful and useful for any future projects and/or challenges.

While it was a slow process I really enjoyed working on painting the terrain in this project. I wanted it to look realistic which resulted in becoming more familiar with the texture properties and experimenting with the brushes and opacity. The trickiest part of this challenge was finding assets that were free and fit the theme of our game. Working together and communicating with my team members helped get through most major bugs. Overall it was pretty fun looking for textures to use on the pyramid and terrain. Creating the body of water definitely tested my creativity and understanding of the texture properties the most. In the end I feel pretty satified with the result of our project.
