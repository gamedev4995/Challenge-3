# Challenge 3

Celebrating Mexico’s Independence day that was September 15th, for this challenge we built an ancient Pyramid and it’s landscape in honor of the many rich cultures that represent Mexico!

## Probuilder
For this proyect we used Probuilder to allow us easy access alteration for our shapes. To see our Probuilder tools, at the menu at the top go to Tools > Probuilder > Probuilder window. This will make our variety of tools visible.

For our Proyect we will be using this tiny window on our scene. The 1st square is Object Selection, the standard Unity settings.  The 2nd is Vertex selection, for editing vertices for detailed editing and functions like vertex splitting and connecting. The 3rd is Edge Selection, to edit edges for semi-complex geometry editing. The last and 4th is Face Selection to select and edit faces on an object, for basic tasks like extruding.

## Materials

We also created our own materials and textures to give our pyramid and landscape a more realistic look to it.
