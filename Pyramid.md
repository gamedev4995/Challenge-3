# Pyramid 
To start off our pyramid, we first need a cube from Probuilder. By clicking GameObject from the top menu, scroll to Probuilder > Cube. Using the Probuilder tools, we select ‘Object Selection’ and scaled our cube to fit the size to our liking. Once done, we now click  ‘Face Selection’ from our tools, and click on the top face of our cube, making it yellow (meaning it was selected). With this, we scale the top down, giving it a triangle shape.

With the same tool already picked, we now use the Move tool to move the top downwards with the y-axis, resulting us with this.

Back with ‘Object Selection’, with the x-axis, we made our cube a bit longer using Scale for our next steps.

We now use our already made materials and textures to give our pyramid a bit of realism to it. Using ‘Face Selection’, we selected all the four side faces of the cube by holding down control(^) and clicking all the sides we wanted. Once every side was selected, we applied our Sand material to it by dragging the material and dropping it on the selected faces, painting it with our Sand texture. For contrast, we painted the top of the cube with a deep brown, resulting us with this.

Next, we duplicated our cube and adjusted the scale of the y and x-coordinates to out liking to result us with the following picture, creating detailed edges and the very first layer of our pyramid.

For symmetry, we made this layer a Prefab and afterwards, duplicated each layer, scaling each layer down for them to sit nicely on top of each other, giving us our pyramid almost completed!

Ramp
For our ramp of the pyramid, we are going to use another Probuilder Cube. Using Scale, we took the y-axis and moved it upward to make our cube longer (the height of our pyramid). Then, using ‘Face Selection’ of the Probuilder tools, we selected the top of the cube and using Move tool and the z-axis, we moved it to the back, creating a ramp looking cube.

We then moved and positioned the ramp back, to intersect our pyramid and connecting the two, resulting like so. We also added our brown material for color and contrast.

To add details to our ramp, we needed two cubes. We simply duplicated the already done ramp above and scaled down the x-coordinate, making the cube thinner. We then moved and positioned it at the edges of our ramp as well changing it’s material to our ‘Sand’ material for more texture and contrast.

To finish our ramp, we duplicated our already done first half and moved it with the x-coordinate to the side, giving it a wider entrance, and have it centered on our pyramid.

Base
Now that our pyramid is taking shape, we added a new cube to act as our base for our pyramid to sit on top of. We scaled our cube big enough to cover our pyramid to then use the y-axis to scale it down and make it as thin to our liking. Our first base was done, we then finished it up by moving it to the center/bottom of our pyramid and added our dark sand material for color.

For the second base, we simply duplicated our first base, and scaled it bigged so it fits our pyramids plus the already done first base.

Lower Ramps
We decided to add ramps as well for our base. We made our already done ramp a prefab, taking every single component of it along.
We duplicated the prefab of our ramp and moved it downwards towards the first layer of the base. To adjust the scaling, we played with the y-axis and z-axis to properly align it to the base, resulting like such:

Afterwards, we duplicated this smaller ramp and moved it downwards again towards the second and last layer of the base while playing along with the y-axis and z-axis again to properly align it, resulting us in the finished ramps of our base.

Temples
For our temple to go at the top of our pyramid we’re starting off with a cube once again. We moved it to sit at the top of our pyramid. Using ‘Face Selection’ from our Probuilder tools, we selected the top face of the cube, and scaled the top down, giving it a triangle shape.

We also added a small base for our temple to sit on with another cube and scaled it down with the y-axis to make it thin.

For the details of our temple, we used the shape Sprite from our Probuilder shapes. We moved the sprite towards the front of our temple and rotated it with the x-axis just slightly so it aligns accordingly to the temple. We then used the tool ‘Vertex Selection’ from Probuilder and moved the position of the top vertex points inward to fit the shape of the temple and added our dark sand material to contrast our sand texture from the temple.

Then, we simply duplicated the Sprite and moved lower said duplicate one with the y-axis. Using  ‘Vertex Selection’ tool, we moved each vertex point to fit the shape of the temple once again.

For our small entrance of the temple, we used a new Sprite. We moved the sprite towards the front of our temple, towards the center and at the bottom. We rotated it with the x-axis just slightly once again so it aligns accordingly to the shape and angle of the temple. We colored the entrance with our brown material to act as the depth of the entrance to the temple.

Now that our temple is done we simply made a prefab of it and its components/details and added another by its side. Moving the position with the x-axis to align it properly by the side of the first, making the two look centered on top of the pyramid.

Our pyramid is now fully completed!
