#Create Terrain
After we’ve built our pyramid we can start creating the terrain.

In the Hierarchy window right click > 3D Object > Terrain. Adjust the Terrain size by going to the Inspector tab down to the Terrain window. Select Terrain Settings (the mountain icon at the end on the right).

Scroll down to Mesh Resolution (On Terrain Data). Change the terrain width and length to 50 each.
