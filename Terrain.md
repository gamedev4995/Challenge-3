# Create Terrain
After we’ve built our pyramid we can start creating the terrain.

In the Hierarchy window right click > 3D Object > Terrain. Adjust the Terrain size by going to the Inspector tab down to the Terrain window. Select Terrain Settings (the mountain icon at the end on the right).

Scroll down to Mesh Resolution (On Terrain Data). Change the terrain width and length to 50 each.

Center the pyramid around on the terrain. You can easily do this by selecting the terrain and using the move tool.

# Set Height 
  Scroll back up to the Terrain properties. Select the Paint Terrain property (the mountain icon with a paintbrush) and select Set Height on the option bar. Make sure Space is set to World. Set the Height field to about 250. Click Flatten All to actualize changes.

# Create the lake
With the terrain object selected, create the lake around by dipping the ground. In the Paint Terrain change Set Height to Raise or Lower Terrain. Select a soft brush with a size of 8-9 and an opacity of 6-7. To lower the terrain, shift and drag the brush around the pyramid. This is easier to do from above on the y-perspective.

Once we are satisfied we can begin applying textures to bring the terrain to life.
